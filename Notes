Angular is like dead man walking.

Why React?

1. In Simple-JS Tic-tac-Toe we have to parse the DOM and find out which square has what element.
2. After every move we will clculate the winner, a fairly expensive operation.

3. We cannot save the game to come back and play later.
  - The only way to do so is to store all the states and teh entire DOM representation .
  - Imaging to save the DOM of Facebook page , ridiculous.
4. How to validate if the square is already taken -
  - We have to check teh innerHTML of teh square to validate.

We should not write to the DOM directly.

Solution -

- Let's just write to a Javascript object .
- Store a game in one place.
- Have a rendering fun. (pure fun)
- Will always do the same thing if you give the same input
- render fun() will output the representation of HTML and then write it to the DOM

Source of truth was teh DOM but should be the Database.
Queries -

1. flex and CSS.
